        <h2>Personal life</h2>
        <p2> 
          Hello there! My name is Nathan Zender, and I lead a diverse and exciting lifestyle. 
          From thrilling outdoor adventures to pursuing my passion for technology and gaming, I always find ways to keep myself engaged and motivated.
        </p2>

        <p2>
          One of my greatest passions is water sports.  Whether it's gliding across serene lakes on water skis, conquering
          snowy slopes on skis, or riding the waves on a wakeboard, I can't resist the call of adrenaline-inducing activities.

          When I'm not enjoying the thrill of the outdoors, you can find me tinkering with my cars. From a young age, 
          both my mother and father contributed to my deep-rooted interest in diagnosis and fixing of any type of mechanical device.
          From ripping apart the top part of engines to replacing the full engine, and from simple wire repair to full harness 
          diagnosis and system I have a very extensive knowledge in how each manufacturer engineers their cars.
          I have learned from these experiences how to go about not only diagnosis of older cars, but also I learned how to continue to learn newer cars as well. 
        </p2>

        <p2>
          Not only do I enjoy fixing cars, but I have also used my skills to earn some extra income. In the past few years,
          Through the auction-based website "Copart," I have purchased most of the cars I've worked on and restored 
          them meticulously from a wrecked state to a completely reliable and drivable condition.
        </p2>

        <p2>
          I am also a member of a college team that competes in CS:GO (Counter-Strike: Global Offensive). 
          Gaming has become an integral part of my life, and being part of a team allows me to sharpen 
          my skills while improving my communication and team-work skills in a fast paced enviornment. 
          In the fall semester of 2022, our team triumphed in the semi-finals of the NACE collegiate tournament ,
          an accomplishment that fills me with pride and show in no small part my dedication to practice and dedication to the Esport.
        </p2>

        <p2>
          Beyond my hobbies, I have a deep love for travel. Exploring new places, experiencing different cultures,
          and meeting diverse people expand my horizons and provide endless inspiration. 
          Interestingly, my car fixing endeavors have turned into a unique opportunity for me to combine my passion for automobiles with my passion for traveling. 
          I often take road trips to pick up cars I am going to fix, and then use that to double as a chance to discover new destinations and make lasting memories along the way.
        </p2>

        <p2>
          Overall, my life is an combination of thrilling adventures, technical pursuits, gaming triumphs, and wanderlust-driven travels. 
          It's the perfect blend of excitement, creativity, and personal growth. I look forward to embarking on new journeys and experiencing everything life has to offer.
